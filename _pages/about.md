Hello! I am Yuemin Li, a second-year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, supervised by [Dr Matteo Fumagalli](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rQhiTmYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof Laurent Frantz](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DCk3qbcAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My PhD research is focused on population genetics to understand the evolutionary processes in the past, especially on domesticated animals.

I gratuated from Imperial College London in 2021 with an MSc degree in Taxonomy, Biodiversity and Evolution. And I obtained my BSc (Hons) degree in Biological Sciences from University of Birmingham in 2020. 

I am orginally from Kunming, China.
